\title{Add a pokemon palette to a ggplot2 colour or fill scale.}
\usage{
scale_colour_poke(..., pokemon = 1, spread = NULL)

scale_fill_poke(..., pokemon = 1, spread = NULL)

scale_color_poke(..., pokemon = 1, spread = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pokemon}{An integer or character pokemon name}

\item{spread}{How many, quite distinct, colours should be returned. See details.}
}
\description{
Get a pokemon palette by either giving a pokemon number or name.
}
\details{
If \code{spread} is given an integer, the full palette is
 clustered into that many groups (ward clustering in HSV space).
 The most common colour in each cluster is then returned. It is
 hoped this will give a good balance between reflecting the pokemons
 colouring while giving relatively distinct colours.
}
\examples{
qplot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, colour = Species, data=iris) +
 scale_colour_poke('Metapod')
}
